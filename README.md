# 🧠 ML Model Training & Tuning (with a little drama)

Welcome to this machine learning project notebook! 🚀  
This project explores a supervised learning model using scikit-learn, with a focus on model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`.

## 📂 Project Description

This notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Result interpretation and visualization

The goal is to build a reliable classification model with optimized performance based on selected parameters.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ⚠️ Fun Fact (or Frustrating One 😅)

While running the `GridSearchCV` block on my trusty **Core i5 laptop (with humble specs)**, it *crashed spectacularly*. 💥 I guess a CPU from the early 2010s has its limits.

So… I'm currently **saving up to build my own custom PC**, fully loaded with a dedicated GPU for proper model training (and peace of mind 😎). Once that rig is ready, I plan to:
- Rerun the heavy model training
- Develop a **web app** (maybe with Flask or FastAPI)  
- Build a **mobile version** (possibly using Flutter or React Native)

Stay tuned. The best is yet to come.

## 📈 Future Work

- Implement more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Cross-validate with stratified K-Folds
- Deploy the model via REST API
- Build a lightweight mobile interface for predictions
